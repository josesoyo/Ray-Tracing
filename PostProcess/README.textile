Postprocessing Library

This part of the code has been designed to perform all the required analysis that will be done after the ray tracing finishes.

Currently it contains some routines to compute ASD of the phase change or sensitivity equivalent for a michelson gravitational wave interferometer. That can be computed directly from the definition and using the welch method with periodograms. Some functions have been added to compute the noise on the quadrants of the photodetectors.
The code is limited by the fact that routines for general analysis are designed to work with sensors added on disc surfaces, so sensors added on a surface with a different form (as could be a spherical surface) must be projected into a disc equivalent. 

Also it contains some functions to compute the noise based on Vinet's paper from 1997 if we analyze a similar system.

Please, note that the routines to perform the analysis of the distribution of the stray light arriving to a surface are not written.
