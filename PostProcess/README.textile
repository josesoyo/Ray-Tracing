This part of the code has been designed to perform all the required analysis that will be done after the ray tracing finishes.

Currently it contains some routines to compute PSD or ASD of the phase change or sensitivity equivalent for a michelson gravitational wave interferometer. That can be computed directly from the definition and using the welch method with periodograms.

Also it contains some functions to compute the noise based on Vinet's paper from 1997 is we analyze a similar system.
